# 🖐️ ASL Hand Sign Detection using YOLOv11

This project is a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) hand sign detection system built using **YOLOv11** for object detection, **FastAPI** for the backend, and **React.js** for the frontend. It detects common ASL signs from a webcam feed and displays them with bounding boxes and labels.
